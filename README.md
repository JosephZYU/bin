Place this bin folder under $HOME (E.g. /home/josephyu/bin)
    
    ðŸ’² export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
    
    ðŸ’² (optional: sudo chmod +x $HOME/bin/script)

    ðŸ’² setup_dotfiles.sh
    ðŸ’² setup_env.sh
    
    ðŸ’² (optional: apt list --installed) (Ref: https://askubuntu.com/a/17829)

NOTE: ðŸ§­ Homebrew (on macOS) and APT (on Ubuntu)

      The purpose of both tools is similar. 
      
      The difference is that APT1 is native, required and fully integrated part of Ubuntu while Homebrew is a 3rd party addition.
      
      And the most important difference from a userâ€™s perspective is that they use different command syntax, although the tasks are quite similar.
      
      If you are used to Homebrew, you can install it on your Ubuntu. 
      
      However, if someone is a pure Ubuntu user, Iâ€™d absolutely encourage them to use their native tool â€“ APT.
